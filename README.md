# DocuChat-AI Local PDF Retrieval Query System
This project was developed as part of my Masterâ€™s in Data Science program. DocuChat AI, a local AI-powered tool that allows users to upload and query PDF documents using natural language â€” powered by Ollamaâ€™s Llama 3.2 model integrated with Open WebUI.

This project focuses on privacy-first AI, where all processing happens locally without sending data to external servers. Users can interact with research papers, reports, or any document to summarize, extract insights, or ask context-specific questions.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

Local LLM inference with Ollama

PDF upload & intelligent querying

Offline data privacy â€“ no cloud dependency

Simple, chat-style WebUI for interaction

ðŸ§  Tech Stack: Python | Ollama (Llama 3.2) | Open WebUI

This project helped me understand the practical deployment of LLMs, environment setup, and integration of local AI tools for document understanding.
